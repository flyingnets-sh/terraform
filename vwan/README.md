![vWAN Demo Architecture](./images/vWAN%20Lab%201.PNG)

This lab deploys the following:
1. A Resource Group in two Azure Regions (based on variables)
2. A vWAN in the Primary Region
3. A vWAN Hub in two Azure Regions
4. A vNet in each Azure Region which is connected to the vWAN Hub.
6. A Subnet and NSG in each of the above vNets. 
7. A Virtual Machine in each Azure Region (in the Regional vNets), to allow testing of Connectivity. Note: these VMs have a Public IP and RDP is enabled for easy testing access. 
8. A Custom Script Extension that runs on both VMs to add a few testing Apps (using Chocolatey) and allows ICMP through Windows Firewall for testing.
